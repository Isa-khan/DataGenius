However, excessive use of gamification could cause students to become slaves to games and distance themselves from other forms of learning. Gamification should be used appropriately side by side with the traditional means of education in order to have the most positive impact on students' lives."

It presents work in a 'fun' way that makes students want to participate. It does, however, not always lend itself to more complicated topics or answers that require longer written responses. Therefore I am not sure that it can be the primary means of education, but it can be a very useful addition to teaching methods."

I definitely would not recommend it as a primary means, but I think as a starter/ plenary to the lesson, it would work well."

In two of my previous schools (Chafford Hundred Campus 2003 - 2006 and Barnfield South Academy 2009 - 10) I led on the implementation of Adobe Atmosphere and Second Life virtual world platforms for the purpose of improving engagement with hard to reach youngsters. I'm afraid to say that Dubai isn't especially well placed to benefit from gamification of learning experiences. Teaching and learning practices tend to be very conservative and lag far behind the kind of practice seen in for instance, Finland or Estonia. "
